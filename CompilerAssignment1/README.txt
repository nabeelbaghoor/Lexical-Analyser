This  Lexer is very simple to use. Just follow these steps:

1 - Put your code in the given "input. cc" file
2 - Run the source.CPP file with any c++ compiler
3 - The token-lexeme pairs will be generated. 
4 - The lexer will output these tokens on the console screen and will write its output to a  file called "output.txt" as well.

Note: Don't worry. If the output.txt file is not already created, the lexer will create it.
