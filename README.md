# Lexical-Analyser

This  Lexer is very simple to use. Just follow these steps:

1 - Put your code in the given "input. cc" file
<br />
2 - Run the source.CPP file with any c++ compiler
<br />
3 - The token-lexeme pairs will be generated. 
<br />
4 - The lexer will output these tokens on the console screen and will write its output to a  file called "output.txt" as well.
<br />

<b> If the output.txt file is not already created, the lexer will create it. </b>
